That means you may **download, manufacture, modify, and sell** drones based on these files. If you **modify the licensed design files** and then **distribute those modified files** or **ship products based on your modified licensed design**, you must make the **corresponding modified design source** for the licensed portions available under **CERN-OHL-W-2.0**, and keep the required copyright/licensing notices.

:::info What's allowed
- ✅ Download and use the design files
- ✅ Manufacture drones for personal use
- ✅ Manufacture and sell drones commercially
- ✅ Modify the designs for your own needs
- ✅ Distribute modified designs (under CERN-OHL-W-2.0)

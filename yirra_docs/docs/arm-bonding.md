# 7. Arm Bonding (DP-409 Workflow)

7.1 **Small batches**

* Mix only enough 3M DP-409 for **1–2 arms** — alignment is more important than speed.

7.2 **Wet both sides**

* Epoxy in the motor-mount socket

* Epoxy in the arm-boss socket

* Epoxy on the CF tube bond area

7.3 **Assemble in order**

1. Tube → motor mount

2. Tube → arm boss

7.4 **Indexing & planarity**

* Put the **spacer under the arm-boss end** so the whole arm sits **flat and planar**

* Sight down the arm and rotate until **motor mount and arm boss are in the same plane**

7.5 **Cure**

* Lay flat, undisturbed

* **24 hours** full cure

* Recommended: do **two arms at a time**, not four

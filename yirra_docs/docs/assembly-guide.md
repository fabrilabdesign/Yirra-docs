# 8. Assembly Guide (Chassis Core → Arms → Top)

8.1 **Pre-assembly staging**

* Lay out: de-supported chassis core, 4x cured arms, ESC/4-in-1, PDB, motors, fasteners, battery rails, top cover, nose cone, GPS

* Confirm **all supports** are removed from the chassis core

8.2 **Chassis core**

* Place the ESC in the central cavity in the correct orientation (motor pads toward arms)

* Check cable channels are clear

8.3 **Power distribution / PDB setup**

* Measure ESC → PDB lead length in situ

* **Pre-tin** the PDB:

  * battery / main **input** pads

  * ESC / accessory **output** pads

* Solder leads, keep them short but not tight, heatshrink where needed

8.4 **Install arm assemblies**

* Fit each bonded arm into the chassis core

* Secure per design (side screws / clamps / plates)

* Check from front/top: all arms in plane

8.5 **Motors → arms → ESC**

* Mount motors to the printed motor mounts

* **Feed motor wires through the arms as you go**

* Trim to length, strip, **tin**, and solder to ESC motor pads

* Dress / tie the wires so they don’t rub props

8.6 **Battery mounting rail attachment**

* Install rails at the specified spacing

* Keep them parallel so packs slide in square

8.7 **Top cover placement**

* Seat the top cover on its index points

* Install fasteners in the correct order (front first if it’s a tight fit)

8.8 **Nose cone & GPS install (TPE)**

* Push GPS into the **TPE pocket on top** of the nose cone

* Pull the tab down, slide GPS in, release to capture

* Plug the GPS harness **before** final nose install if access is tight

* Route the GPS cable back along the centerline, **away from high-EMI runs**

* Note in guide: “This location is deliberately isolated and forward for better GPS performance.”

8.9 **O4 Pro installation**

* Mount in the designated bay

* Keep access to SD/USB

* Avoid crushing antenna leads

8.10 **Antenna cable routing**

* Route so they clear props

* Keep them away from main battery leads

* Use printed tie-points

# 5. 3D Printing Guide (with support removal & drying)

5.1 **Dry the nylon first**

* “If you’re not sure it’s dry, dry it again.”

* Wet nylon = weak parts + ugly supports.

5.2 **Load & plate prep**

* Load dried filament.

* **Thin, even glue-stick** layer on the bed specifically for nylon.

5.3 **Use the supplied 3MFs**

* Open in Bambu Studio.

* Prefer to print **as-is** (orientation, walls, infill already sane).

* Check temps/fan against the table in the guide.

5.4 **Print these parts first**
![Chassis](/img/drone/Chassis.gif)

* Chassis core

* Motor mounts

* Arm bosses

5.5 **Support removal (tree supports)**

* Let parts cool fully.

* Start at the root, use flush cutters, don’t rip.

* Take extra care around **internal channels in the chassis core**.

5.6 **Filament drying (no dryer?)**

* Print smaller parts first

* Store in sealed tub with desiccant

* Reprint structural parts if you see porosity/strings.

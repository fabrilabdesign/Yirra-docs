| **Wire strippers** | 14-28 AWG range |
| **Pliers** (needle-nose) | Wire handling |

### Recommended

- **Digital calipers** (0.01mm resolution) — Dimensional verification
- **Drill bits** — Reaming arm tube holes, pilot holes
- **Sandpaper** (220, 400, 600 grit) — Surface finishing
- **Hobby knife** — Cleanup, trimming
- **Helping hands** or PCB holder
- **Magnifier/loupe** for small work
- **Deburring tool** for carbon edges

### Carbon Tube Cutting

## Soldering Equipment

### Required

| Item | Specification |
|------|--------------|
| **Soldering station** | Temperature controlled, 300-400°C capable |
| **Soldering iron tips** | Chisel tip (3-4mm) for power, fine tip for signals |
| **Solder** | 60/40 or 63/37 rosin core, 0.8-1.0mm diameter |
| **Flux** | No-clean or rosin flux |
| **Solder wick** | For desoldering/cleanup |
| **Heat shrink** | Various sizes (2mm-10mm) |
| **Heat gun** | For shrink tubing |

### Consumables

- **Isopropyl alcohol** (90%+) for cleaning flux
- **Cotton swabs** for PCB cleaning
- **Solder tip cleaner** (brass wool)
- **Fire-safe work surface** (silicone mat)

:::tip Soldering Safety
- Work in ventilated area
- Use fume extractor if available
- Wear safety glasses
- Keep fire extinguisher nearby
:::

## Adhesives & Chemicals

| Product | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Threadlocker Blue** (Loctite 243) | Metal fasteners (removable) |
| **CA Glue** (cyanoacrylate) | Tube tips (if specified in assembly) |
| **Epoxy** (5-minute) | Permanent bonds, rare use |
| **Isopropyl Alcohol 90%+** | Flux cleaning, surface prep |

:::warning Threadlocker Application
- **Blue only** (medium strength, removable)
- Apply sparingly (1 drop)
- Metal-to-metal joints only (not plastic)
- Let cure 10-15 minutes before torquing
:::

## Measuring & Testing Equipment

### Essential

- **Digital multimeter** (voltage, continuity, resistance)
- **Smoke stopper** (current-limiting device for first power-up)
- **Battery voltage checker/alarm**
- **Balance charger** (for 6S Li-ion/LiPo)

### Recommended

- **GPS configuration tool** (u-center for ublox modules)

## Computer & Software

### Required Software

- **Betaflight Configurator** or **INAV Configurator**
- **Blackbox Explorer** (for tuning)
- **ESC firmware tool** (BLHeli Configurator)
- **GPS configuration tool** (u-center for ublox)

### Recommended

- **PrusaSlicer / Cura / Simplify3D** (for slicing STLs)
- **OpenTX/EdgeTX Companion** (for radio setup)
- **DJI Assistant** (for O4/O3 updates)

## Workspace Setup

### Bench Requirements

- **Clean, well-lit workspace** (minimum 1m x 0.8m)
- **ESD-safe mat** (for electronics work)
- **Good lighting** (task lamp, 1000+ lumens)
- **Magnification** (hands-free magnifier helpful)

### Organization

- Parts bins for fasteners
- Labeled storage for components
- Cable management (zip lock bags)
- Work-in-progress documentation

## Safety Equipment

:::danger Required Safety Gear

- **Safety glasses** - Always when cutting, drilling, or working with chemicals
- **Nitrile gloves** - For resin, solvents, and adhesives
- **Fire extinguisher** - Class C rated for electrical fires
- **LiPo charging bag** - NEVER charge batteries unattended
- **First aid kit** - For minor cuts and burns

:::

### Battery Safety

- **LiPo/Li-ion safe bag** for storage and charging
- **Fireproof container** for damaged cells
- **Voltage checker** to monitor cell health
- **Storage mode charger** (3.7-3.8V per cell)

## Consumables to Stock

Keep these items on hand:

- Heat shrink tubing (various sizes)
- Zip ties (2-3mm, multiple lengths)
- Solder (25-50g)
- Flux (10ml bottle)
- Threadlocker (5ml)
- Isopropyl alcohol (500ml)

## Tool Investment Estimate

Budget guidance for tool acquisition:

| Category | Budget Option | Premium Option |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Soldering** | $30-50 | $100-200 |
| **Hand Tools** | $40-60 | $150-300 |
| **Measuring** | $20-40 | $100-200 |
| **3D Printer** | $200-400 | $800-2000 |

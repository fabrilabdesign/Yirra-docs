# Build Overview

## What You're Building

**Replicant GEN 1 (IC‑01)** is a 3D‑printable long‑range FPV platform designed around **modular battery rails**, **tubular carbon arms**, and a **refined aerodynamic shell** that reduces build mess and camera jello.

### Core Design Philosophy

* **Printable structural shells** with internal exospine for strength
* **Tubular carbon‑fiber arms** (11mm OD) with printed roots and tips — fully replaceable
* **Modular rail‑mounted battery system** with integrated on/off power button — no straps or velcro needed
* **Camera isolation system** rigidly coupled to battery mount for vibration-free footage
* **Open STL ecosystem** — fully serviceable, upgradeable, and repairable by design
* **DJI O4 Pro exclusive compatibility** for professional cinema-quality video transmission

The innovative battery rail system eliminates the hassle of straps and provides consistent mounting every flight. The integrated power button provides clean on/off control without additional switches.

#### Key Innovations

**Modular Battery Rails**
- Hot-swap capable in seconds
- Integrated power button for clean system control
- Strong mechanical coupling to camera for vibration isolation
- Repeatable center of gravity every battery change

**Open-Source Design**
- All STL files available for modification
- User-serviceable components
- Upgradeable subassemblies
- Community-driven improvements

**Professional Video Integration**
- DJI O4 Pro optimized mounting
- Camera isolation rigidly linked to battery structure
- Minimizes jello and vibration artifacts
- Cinema-grade footage capability

### Compatibility

- **Video Transmission**: DJI O4 Pro / O3
- **Flight Controllers**: F7/H7 (30.5 or 25.5 mm pattern)
- **ESC**: iFlight Blitz E55 (required - only ESC that fits unmodified shells)
- **Motors**: 7–8″ class for 6S (1300–1700 KV)
- **Propellers**: 7-8" for long range efficiency

### Available Options

Choose how you want to build from our [Products Page](https://yirrasystems.com/products):

#### **Digital STL Pack**
Instant download of all printable airframe parts. Best if you have a 3D printer and want to source hardware yourself.

#### **Physical Frame Kit**  
Pre-printed shells + rail blocks with exact fit/finish. Just add electronics and fly.

#### **Long‑Range FPV Solution**
Curated configuration for endurance-oriented builds with reference BOM and tuning baseline.

### Build Difficulty

- **Beginner**: If using physical frame kit + following our tested BOM
- **Intermediate**: If printing your own frames and sourcing electronics
- **Advanced**: If customizing configurations or developing new variants

### Estimated Build Time

- **Printing** (if DIY): 40-80 hours depending on parts and printer
- **Assembly**: 6-10 hours for first build
- **Tuning & Testing**: 2-4 hours

## Safety First

:::danger Important Safety Guidelines

- Wear **eye protection** during assembly and testing
- Use a **smoke‑stopper** on first power‑ups
- Flight‑test only in **approved areas** away from people and property
- Follow **local UAV regulations**
- Properly handle and store Li-ion/LiPo batteries

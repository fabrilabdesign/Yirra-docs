# Drone Assembly

With your arms bonded and cured, it's time to bring everything together. This guide walks through the key assembly steps using our animated references.

:::tip Work Clean
Keep your workspace clear and components organized. Small fasteners and cables are easy to lose in a cluttered environment.

## 1: Heat Set Insert Installation

Heat set inserts provide secure, threaded mounting points throughout the frame. Proper installation ensures reliable fastener retention during flight.

</video>

**Installation technique:**
- Use a soldering iron or heat gun set to the insert manufacturer's specifications
- Insert straight and hold until the plastic cools and solidifies
- Verify each insert is flush and secure before proceeding
- Allow cooling time between installations to prevent frame warping

---

## 2: GPS Installation

The GPS module mounts to the top of the frame, positioned for optimal satellite visibility away from interference sources.

</video>

**Key points:**
- Orient the GPS arrow marking forward (toward the nose)
- Ensure the module sits flat with no cable strain
- Route the cable cleanly to avoid the prop arc

---

## 3: Install 250mm Right Angle Antenna Cable

Install the 250mm right angle antenna cable for optimal positioning and signal quality.

</video>

**Installation:**
- Route cable through designated conduit
- Ensure right angle connector faces correct direction
- Leave adequate length for final positioning
- Secure with cable ties to prevent movement

## 4: O4 Pro Camera Placement in Nose Cone

The DJI O4 Pro camera feeds through the nose cone housing before locking into position.

<video width="100%" controls autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
  <source src="/videos/04_pro_mounting.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

**Installation sequence:**
1. Feed the MIPI ribbon cable through the nose cone first
2. Guide the camera module toward the portal opening
3. Push past the opening — the housing will flex slightly
4. The camera will drop and seat into its final position

:::info
The nose cone is designed to flex during insertion. Don't force it — steady pressure is all that's needed.

---

## 6: Prepare Battery Rail with Wiring

Prepare the battery rail with all necessary wiring harnesses before installation.

<video width="100%" controls autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
  <source src="/videos/Battery_rail_power_cable_route.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

**Preparation steps:**
- Install XT60 connector and power leads
- Add balance leads if required
- Install mounting hardware
- Test electrical continuity

---

## 7: Run Power Cable from Power Distribution Board to Stack and Mount Battery Rail and Bottom Plate

Route power cables from the PDB to the ESC stack while mounting the battery rail and bottom plate. Allow enough slack for cables to run under the O4 Pro air unit.

**[Video placeholder - new video needed]**

**Cable routing considerations:**
- Keep power cables away from signal wires to reduce interference
- Ensure sufficient slack for movement under air unit
- Secure cables with ties or clips to prevent snagging
- Mount battery rail and bottom plate simultaneously for alignment

---

## 8: Mount ESC and Wire Power Connectors

Install ESCs and connect power from the PDB to each motor controller.

<video width="100%" controls autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
  <source src="/videos/Mount_ESC_WIRE_PDB.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

**Installation sequence:**
- Mount ESCs to designated positions
- Connect power leads from PDB
- Route motor wires cleanly
- Secure all connections with heat shrink or connectors

---

## 9: Mount Arms and Wire to ESC

Attach the front and rear arms to the chassis and connect motor wires to ESCs.

  <source src="/videos/Front_arm_attachment.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

**Arm mounting:**
- Align arm boss with chassis mounting points
- Insert fasteners in sequence — don't fully tighten until all are started
- Connect motor wires to corresponding ESCs
- Verify arm angle matches design specification

---

## 10: Install Antenna Cable on Rear Spine Mounting Boss

Install the antenna cable mounting hardware on the rear spine. Ensure no support material remains in the mounting hole.

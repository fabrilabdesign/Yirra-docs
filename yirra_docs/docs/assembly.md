# Drone Assembly

With your arms bonded and cured, it's time to bring everything together. This guide walks through the key assembly steps using our animated references.

:::tip Work Clean
Keep your workspace clear and components organized. Small fasteners and cables are easy to lose in a cluttered environment.

## Front Arm Attachment

Begin by securing the front arms to the chassis. Proper alignment here sets the foundation for the entire build.

**Key points:**
- Align the arm boss with the chassis mounting points
- Insert fasteners in sequence — don't fully tighten until all are started
- Verify arm angle matches the design specification

---

## Rear Arm Mounting

With the front arms in place, attach the rear arms using the same technique.

</video>

**Installation notes:**
- Mirror the process from the front arm attachment
- Check for symmetry between left and right sides
- Torque all fasteners evenly once positioned

---

## Battery Rail and Power Cable Routing

The battery rail provides secure mounting while the power cables need clean routing to the ESC stack.

</video>

**Routing considerations:**
- Keep power cables away from signal wires to reduce interference
- Ensure battery lead has sufficient slack for insertion/removal
- Secure cables with ties or clips to prevent movement during flight

---

## Antenna Cable Conduit (Rear)

Route antenna cables through the rear conduit to protect them and maintain a clean build.

</video>

**Tips:**
- Don't kink or sharply bend coaxial cables — this degrades signal quality
- Leave enough length for antenna positioning adjustments
- Verify cables are seated in the conduit before closing

---

## GPS Installation

The GPS module mounts to the top of the frame, positioned for optimal satellite visibility away from interference sources.

</video>

**Key points:**
- Orient the GPS arrow marking forward (toward the nose)
- Ensure the module sits flat with no cable strain
- Route the cable cleanly to avoid the prop arc

## O4 Pro Camera Placement

The DJI O4 Pro camera feeds through the front housing before locking into position.

</video>

**Installation sequence:**
1. Feed the MIPI ribbon cable through the housing first
2. Guide the camera module toward the round front portal
3. Push past the portal opening — the housing will flex slightly
4. The camera will drop and seat into its final position

:::info
The housing is designed to flex during insertion. Don't force it — steady pressure is all that's needed.

## O4 Pro Air Unit Mounting

The air unit sits in the main bay, positioned for optimal cooling and cable routing.

</video>

**Mounting notes:**
- Ensure adequate clearance for heat dissipation
- Secure all cable connections before final mounting
- Verify antenna placement doesn't obstruct prop rotation

---

## Mounting Nose Cone

The nose cone provides aerodynamic shaping and protects the front-facing electronics.

</video>

**Installation:**
- Align the nose cone with the front housing
- Ensure camera lens has clear line of sight
- Confirm secure fitment before flight

---

## Pre-Flight Checklist

Before powering up for the first time:

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| Prop clearance | All props spin freely with no contact |
| Cable routing | No cables in prop arc |
| Fasteners | All mounting screws secure |
| Antenna placement | Clear of obstructions |
| GPS orientation | Arrow pointing forward |
| Camera alignment | Level and unobstructed |

## Completed Frame

This is what your assembled frame should look like before electronics installation:

![Completed chassis frame](/img/drone/Chassis.gif)

All arms should be symmetrically positioned, fasteners fully torqued, and cable routing complete.

## Next Steps

1. Complete [Firmware Setup](/docs/inav) for iNav configuration
2. Perform bench test before maiden flight
3. Double-check all connections after first battery cycle
